## Personal Website Frontend

This repository contains the frontend for a personal website built with
[Next.js](src/README.md). It provides a basic professional presence with pages for
an about section, projects and a contact form. The backend for handling form
submissions will live in a separate project.

### Development

```bash
cd src
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at <http://localhost:3000>.
